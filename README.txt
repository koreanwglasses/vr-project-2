# A Strange Breakfast

Thank you for participating in this experiment. Just follow my instructions and
I promise I'll keep you safe.

In front of you are two tables. Let us begin with the objects on the left. You
are hungry, interact with the bread (get close and press the trigger) on the
plate to take a bite. You can pick it up and throw it (literally throw) it away 
when youre done.

You're probably thirsty. Next up is the glass. But if you're anything like me,
you *will* break it. Don't worry. It happens to everyone. Oh, and don't touch
the shards...it bluescreens my computer. 

Now that you're done, make sure to turn off the light before you leave! You can
throw it too.

That was soo much fun... but we can do better!

On the table to the right you see another plate with bread. Take a bite! 
Haha if this were real, your teeth would be *toast*.

Try playing around with the glass, you'll notice that it's *lighter*.

What's so different about this lamp? Why don't we *shed some light* on this
mystery? Haha jk, the sun's gone. 

This is just a regular bowl.
